        <p>
          Metroid Dread is an action-adventure game developed by MercurySteam
          and Nintendo EPD, released on October 8, 2021, for the Nintendo
          Switch. Players control bounty hunter Samus Aran as she investigates
          the source of a mysterious transmission on the planet ZDR. It retains
          the side-scrolling gameplay of previous 2D Metroid games and
          incorporates stealth elements. Dread was conceived for the Nintendo DS
          in the mid-2000s, but was canceled due to technical limitations.
          Industry commentators expressed interest in a new 2D Metroid game, and
          listed Dread in their "most wanted" lists. After their work on
          Metroid: Samus Returns in 2017, Metroid producer Yoshio Sakamoto
          appointed MercurySteam to develop Dread, the first original
          side-scrolling Metroid game since Metroid Fusion (2002). Nintendo
          announced the game at E3 2021. The game received positive reviews upon
          its release.
